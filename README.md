## Lessons Learned
I have experiences designing simple forms in HTML with frameworks like Bootstrap, but for me this was an exercise in designing a genuinely appealing signup page, which can help to attract users. I tried to organize my HTML 
and CSS well for this project, using emmett shortcuts to speed up the HTML and CSS variables and functions to make the site have a consistent color scheme. This was maybe the first project I felt I had actual control over
the CSS and could make it do what I wanted to. I also learned a lot about responsive design, as this was my first intentionally responsive project. I think going forward I will be able to plan ahead for responsiveness so it 
won't take me as long. Other than that, it was just genuine fun toying with the design of the form/site, trying to make it feel responvsive and intuitive, as well as accessible.
